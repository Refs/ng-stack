# @ng-stack

This Angular library contains several projects:
- [default Angular project](./src) contains defined a highly scalable folder structure (at least, the author of this library thinks so).
- [@ng-stack/contenteditable](./projects/contenteditable) - a micro Angular v4+ contenteditable directive for integration with Angular forms. It just implements ControlValueAccessor for this purpose.
- [@ng-stack/api-mock](./projects/api-mock) - this is an alternative of [angular-in-memory-web-api](https://github.com/angular/in-memory-web-api).
